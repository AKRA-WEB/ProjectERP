## SQL Patterns Used
- **Wraparound Anniversaries:** Finding events across year-end boundaries using `TO_CHAR(MM-DD)`.
- **Timezone Formatting:** Using `AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Bangkok'` for consistent clock-in/out display.
- **Conditional Gating:** Server-side role checks to nullify sensitive fields (base_salary).

## Engineering Standards
- **Component Pattern:** Local `Avatar` and `StatusBadge` for high-density information display.
- **Linting:** Strict type safety with specific interfaces for all SQL result sets (no `any`).
- **Performance:** Paginated lists and optimized counts using PostgreSQL `FILTER` clause.
